# Bayesian logistic regression with PyMC3
During my internship at Kibo Commerce, my mentor <a href="https://austinrochford.com/"> Austin Rochford. </a>
introduced me to the powerful probabilistic programming package PyMC3 (he is one of the contributors). 

As a scientist, I am immediately hooked by the ideas of this library. There are so many things that I love about it; just to name a few: numerical computations, automatic differentiation, simulations with Markov Chain Monte Carlo method, and above all, a huge potential to solve real-world problems. 

I decided to master this library by doing some hands-on projects. This is my first project in the series. More precisely, I will use PyMC3 to do Bayesian logistic regression using the following public dataset: 
<a href="https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Occupancy+Detection+"> Occupancy Detection Data Set. </a>

The dataset contains several variables such as light, temperature, humidity, and CO2 levels. The goal is to detect a room's occupancy from these variables.
